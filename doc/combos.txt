Attaching certain elements and micros to other ones enhances their functionality


Painter <- Bitmap  clicking the bitmap selects it in the Painter
Painter <- Tileset clicking the (opened) tileset selects a tile in the Painter

Command <- Command, Number or Stringfield 
    - the children will have connector arrows to show order of operation
    - the children will be executed before the parent command's text
        when it is triggered
    - Commands, Numbers, and Stringfields will have an %EXECUTABLE trait
        - Many other elements can then be executed too, even Bitmaps and Micros
    - first intended use: a tileset creation widget
