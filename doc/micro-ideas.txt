  Temporal:
  - Frame/tick events - global heartbeat
  - Scheduled callbacks - "call me in 0.5 seconds"
  - Animation events - "hit frame", "animation ended"

  Spatial (beyond collision):
  - Proximity queries - "who's near me?" without touching
  - Raycasts/Line of sight - can I see target?
  - Screen/viewport queries - am I on screen?

  Resource/Economy:
  - Shared pools - health, ammo, score, mana that multiple machines read/write
  - Inventories - items, powerups

  Entity relationships:
  - Parent entity reference - the actor/sprite this machine controls
  - Scene graph queries - find by name/type/group
  - Ownership - "my bullets" vs "enemy bullets"

  State:
  - Reactive values/Signals - notify on change (vs polling)
  - Blackboard - AI knowledge base
  - State machine transitions - enter/exit notifications

  System:
  - Audio triggers - play sound, react to music beat
  - Camera events - shake, follow, bounds
  - Scene transitions - level load, checkpoint

  Multiplayer (if applicable):
  - Network messages
  - Sync/authoritative state
